Tipster is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: Kyle Wilson

Time spent: 20 hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [x] Settings page to change the default tip percentage (slightly more detailed than required; exact tip amount for each performance rating can be changed.)

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [x] UI animations
* [x] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [x] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] Automatically displays bill splits for groups of 2-4 people
- [x] Round to nearest whole currency unit option
- [x] Include tax before tip option
- [x] Shake to clear option
- [x] Added size classes; should work across all modern iPhone models
- [x] Launch screen and logo matching app's color scheme

## Notes

Although I was able to manipulate the alpha value of the detailView, I was unsuccessful in my attempts to implement sliding animations on the frame properties. I believe it has something to do with the view hierarchy, and I am still trying to resolve the issue. In addition, given more time and assistance, I would like to change the color scheme of the settings view to match that of the initial view.
